       "  '  Results from spectroscopic observations of the Intermediate Polar (IP) EX Hya\\nin quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial\\nvelocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first\\ntime in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600\\nkm/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the\\nouter edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion\\ncurtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler\\ntomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending\\nfrom velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the\\ntheoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and\\nNorton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that\\nextend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence\\nfor overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,\\nconfirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is\\npresent during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and\\nhgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the\\nouter disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of\\nmaterial along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and\\nclose to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the\\naccretion curtain model.\\n',\n",

Computations carried out\\nwith a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson\\nand Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to\\ndynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look\\nfor dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm.

Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of\\nthe quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal\\nsignificant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8\\nmHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer\\nperiods in network regions.

The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted\\ninto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC\\nCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and\\nvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations.

In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and\\nelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\\n(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\\nphase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the\\nenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless\\nwave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the\\nphase space and leads to ion heating.

       "  '  Possible (algebraic) commutation relations in the Lagrangian quantum theory\\nof free (scalar, spinor and vector) fields are considered from mathematical\\nview-point. As sources of these relations are employed the Heisenberg\\nequations/relations for the dynamical variables and a specific condition for\\nuniqueness of the operators of the dynamical variables (with respect to some\\nclass of Lagrangians). The paracommutation relations or some their\\ngeneralizations are pointed as the most general ones that entail the validity\\nof all Heisenberg equations. The simultaneous fulfillment of the Heisenberg\\nequations and the uniqueness requirement turn to be impossible. This problem is\\nsolved via a redefinition of the dynamical variables, similar to the normal\\nordering procedure and containing it as a special case. That implies\\ncorresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. The introduction\\nof the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutation\\nrelations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variables\\nis reduced to normal ordering. As a last restriction on that class is imposed\\nthe requirement for existing of an effective procedure for calculating vacuum\\nmean values. The standard bilinear commutation relations are pointed as the\\nonly known ones that satisfy all of the mentioned conditions and do not\\ncontradict to the existing data.\\n',\n",

       "  '  Epitaxial self-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs) are of interest for\\nnanostructured optoelectronic and electronic devices such as lasers,\\nphotodetectors and nanoscale logic. Spatial order and size order of SAQDs are\\nimportant to the development of usable devices. It is likely that these two\\ntypes of order are strongly linked; thus, a study of spatial order will also\\nhave strong implications for size order. Here a study of spatial order is\\nundertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of SAQD formation\\nbased on surface diffusion. Analytic formulas for film-height correlation\\nfunctions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order and\\ncorresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. Initial atomic-scale\\nrandom fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about two\\ndots) when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible; however, the\\ncorrelation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-critical\\nfilm height. The present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy and\\nSAQD order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering with\\ncorresponding analytic equations. In addition, SAQD formation is by its nature\\na stochastic process, and various mathematical aspects regarding statistical\\nanalysis of SAQD formation and order are presented.\\n',\n",

       "  '  The goal of this paper is to construct invariant dynamical objects for a (not\\nnecessarily invertible) smooth self map of a compact manifold. We prove a\\nresult that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms\\nof a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite\\ndimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant\\nsubspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological\\nclasses and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given\\ntype, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes\\nand are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a\\nplethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is\\nimportant. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth\\nrate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives\\nsufficient \"marching orders\" to the system to prohibit the formation of any\\nother such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical\\nsubsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give\\nconditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf\\ncontaining it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf\\ncohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified\\nwith the deRham cohomology groups. Our main theorem can be applied in both the\\nsmooth and holomorphic setting.\\n',\n",

We\\nemploy Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary\\nanalytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These\\nsolutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in\\na finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups\\nsignal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up\\ntime $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\\\\sim\\n(t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\\\\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while\\nthe velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock\\ndiscontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the\\nsingularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas\\npressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time\\nclose to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density\\nblowup, of the same type, may coexist with an \"ordinary\" shock, at which the\\nhydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the\\nexact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving\\nthe ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutions\\nshow that the local features of the density blowup hold universally,\\nindependently of details of the initial and boundary conditions.\\n',\n",

       "  '  We discuss a universality property of any covariant field theory in\\nspace-time expanded around pp-wave backgrounds. According to this property the\\nspace-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field\\nconfigurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the\\npp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the\\nbackground scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial\\nfields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell\\npp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal\\nsector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to\\nthe pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results\\ncan also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also\\nstudy such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In\\nparticular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse\\nspace and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition\\nrelating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive\\nmodes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this\\nsimplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on\\nthe two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an\\niterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT\\nequations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analyses\\ncan be generalised to the common Neveu-Schwarz sector of superstrings.\\n',\n",

For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin\\na=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits\\nwhose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit\\'s inclination with respect\\nto the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.\\nThis behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite\\nto the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted\\npreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to\\nthe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysis\\ngeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)\\nfamily of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits\\nreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming\\norbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial\\nconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing\\norbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial\\nconfiguration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the\\nearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly\\nhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes\\nbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to\\nequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for\\neccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination\\nchange is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are\\nnot likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms\\nexpected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA.\\n',\n",

We stress that the experimental reconstruction of hadron spectral\\nfunctions from measured decay products always requires knowledge of the decay\\nbranching ratios which may also be strongly mass-dependent.

       "  \"  Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and let $\\\\F$ be a codimension one, $C^\\\\infty$\\nfoliation on $M$, with isolated singularities of Morse type. The study and\\nclassification of pairs $(M,\\\\F)$ is a challenging (and difficult) problem. In\\nthis setting, a classical result due to Reeb \\\\cite{Reeb} states that a manifold\\nadmitting a foliation with exactly two center-type singularities is a sphere.\\nIn particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function. Along these\\nlines a result due to Eells and Kuiper \\\\cite{Ku-Ee} classify manifolds having a\\nreal-valued function admitting exactly three non-degenerate singular points. In\\nthe present paper, we prove a generalization of the above mentioned results. To\\ndo this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularities\\nand the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give an\\nelimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and some saddle-saddle\\nconfigurations (of consecutive indices). In the second part, we investigate if\\nother classical results, such as Haefliger and Novikov (Compact Leaf) theorems,\\nproved for regular foliations, still hold true in presence of singularities. At\\nthis purpose, in the singular set, $Sing(\\\\F)$ of the foliation $\\\\F$, we\\nconsider {\\\\em{weakly stable}} components, that we define as those components\\nadmitting a neighborhood where all leaves are compact. If $Sing(\\\\F)$ admits\\nonly weakly stable components, given by smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphic\\nto $S^1$, we are able to extend Haefliger's theorem. Finally, the existence of\\na closed curve, transverse to the foliation, leads us to state a Novikov-type\\nresult.\\n\",\n",

This is primarily due to line contamination and overdensities probably\\ncreated by large-scale structure. By comparing the HI absorption and the\\ncorresponding HeII absorption, we estimated the fluctuating spectral shape of\\nthe extragalactic UV radiation field along this line of sight. We find that the\\nUV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the three\\nforeground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV background\\nmodels dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metal\\nline systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraints\\non the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasars\\nshow a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of\\nthe UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.\\nThus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also in\\noverdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.\\nFurthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiative\\ntransfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observed\\nspectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect of\\nQSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.\\n',\n",

These knots\\nare extremely rare, but their occurrence is likely connected to protein\\nfunction in as yet unexplored fashion. Our analysis of the complete Protein\\nData Bank reveals several new knots which, along with previously discovered\\nones, can shed light on such connections. In particular, we identify the most\\ncomplex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest that\\nits entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by the\\nproteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species and\\nsometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which only\\nappears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins of\\nsimilar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in the\\nenzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of a\\nshort DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into a\\nknotted structure in this protein.\\n',\n",

Our Spitzer census supplemented by ground based spectra has added 42\\nclass II T-Tauri sources to the cluster membership and identified ~20 class 0/I\\nprotostars. The population of IC 348 likely exceeds 400 sources after\\naccounting statistically for unidentified diskless members. Our Spitzer census\\nof IC 348 reveals a population of protostars that is anti-correlated spatially\\nwith the T-Tauri members, which comprise the centrally condensed cluster around\\na B star. The protostars are instead found mostly at the cluster periphery\\nabout 1 pc from the B star and spread out along a filamentary ridge. We find\\nthat the star formation rate in this protostellar ridge is consistent with that\\nrate which built the exposed cluster while the presence of fifteen cold,\\nstarless, millimeter cores intermingled with this protostellar population\\nindicates that the IC 348 nebula has yet to finish forming stars. We show that\\nthe IC 348 cluster is of order 3-5 crossing times old, and, as evidenced by its\\nsmooth radial profile and confirmed mass segregation, is likely relaxed. While\\nit seems apparent that the current cluster configuration is the result of\\ndynamical evolution and its primordial structure has been erased, our findings\\nsupport a model where embedded clusters are built up from numerous smaller\\nsub-clusters. Finally, the results of our Spitzer census indicate that the\\nsupposition that star formation must progress rapidly in a dark cloud should\\nnot preclude these observations that show it can be relatively long lived.\\n',\n",

The basic principle behind this approach is called the\\nflip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the\\nlower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to\\nthe positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems):\\nspecifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the\\nfundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic\\ngeometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed\\nforms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this\\narticle, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that\\nthese relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of\\nthe preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical\\npositivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive\\nformulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural\\nconstants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These\\nturn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the\\nKazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the\\ncanonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum\\ngroups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann\\nhypothesis over finite fields and the related results. Thus the reduction here,\\nin conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the P vs.\\nNP conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the Riemann\\nhypothesis over finite fields and related problems.\\n',\n",

Basaltic asteroids can be\\nidentified from their visible reflectance spectra and are classified as V-type\\nin the usual taxonomies. In this work, we report visible spectroscopic\\nobservations of two candidate V-type asteroids, (7472) Kumakiri and (10537)\\n1991 RY16, located in the outer Main Belt (a > 2.85 UA). These candidate have\\nbeen previously identified by Roig and Gil-Hutton (2006, Icarus 183, 411) using\\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey colors. The spectroscopic observations have been\\nobtained at the Calar Alto Observatory, Spain, during observational runs in\\nNovember and December 2006. The spectra of these two asteroids show the steep\\nslope shortwards of 0.70 microns and the deep absorption feature longwards of\\n0.75 microns that are characteristic of V-type asteroids. However, the presence\\nof a shallow but conspicuous absorption band around 0.65 microns opens some\\nquestions about the actual mineralogy of these two asteroids. Such band has\\nnever been observed before in basaltic asteroids with the intensity we detected\\nit. We discuss the possibility for this shallow absorption feature to be caused\\nby the presence of chromium on the asteroid surface. Our results indicate that,\\ntogether with (1459) Magnya, asteroids (7472) Kumakiri and (10537) 1991 RY16\\nmay be the only traces of basaltic material found up to now in the outer Main\\nBelt.\\n',\n",

We find that the\\noccultation fringes cannot be fit by any single-size model. We use the DUSTY\\nradiative transfer code to model a circumstellar shell and fit both the\\nobserved occultation light curves and the spectral energy distribution\\ndescribed in the literature. We find a strong constraint on the inner radius of\\nthe dust shell, Tmax = 950 K +/- 50K, and optical depth at 5um of 0.5 +/- 0.1.\\nThe observations are best fit by models with a density gradient of r^-2 or the\\ngradient derived by Ivezic & Elitzur for a radiatively driven hydrodynamic\\noutflow. Our models cannot fit the observed IRAS 60um flux without assuming a\\nsubstantial abundance of graphite or by assuming a substantially higher\\nmass-loss rate in the past.\\n',\n",

       "  \"  (Abridged) We compare recent results from X-ray, strong lensing, weak\\nlensing, and optical observations with numerical simulations of the merging\\ngalaxy cluster 1E0657-56. X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster\\nwith a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of\\nthe total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless\\ngalaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies,\\nbased on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the\\nself-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, using\\nsimplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new,\\nhigher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of\\n1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and\\ncomparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow for\\na new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observation\\nof an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. This\\nnew method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. If\\nwe make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal\\nmass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringent\\nconstraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of the\\nsubcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with the\\nuniversal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark\\nmatter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slight\\nimprovement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules out\\nmost of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between the\\nstandard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.\\n\",\n",

Aims: This motivates planet searches around\\nstars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and in\\nparticular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.\\nMethods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5\\ndwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internal\\nerrors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersion\\nis due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.\\nResults: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where each\\nplanet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)\\nmagnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day period\\ncoincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates in\\na spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on the\\nother hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b. Conclusion: Its detection\\nadds to the growing number of Neptune-mass planets around M-dwarfs, and\\nreinforces the emerging conclusion that this mass domain is much more populated\\nthan the jovian mass range. We discuss the metallicity distributions of M dwarf\\nwith and without planets and find a low 11% probability that they are drawn\\nfrom the same parent distribution. Moreover, we find tentative evidence that\\nthe host star metallicity correlates with the total mass of their planetary\\nsystem.\\n',\n",

The observed region includes\\nthe\\n  S140 H${\\\\alpha}$ arc. This spectral line is seen here in absorption against\\nthe cosmic microwave background, indicating the presence of widespread warm\\nmolecular gas at intermediate densities. Overall, the distributions of H$_2$CO\\nand CO (taken from the literature) are fairly similar, though significant\\ndifferences exist at small scales. Most notably, while the CO peak is nearly\\ncoincident with the S140 H${\\\\alpha}$ arc, the maximum H$_2$CO absorption is\\nclearly separated from it by a full 10$'$ beam ($\\\\sim$ 3 pc). We argue that\\nthese differences result from differing abundances and excitation requirements.\\nThe CO(1-0) line is more optically thick and more biased towards warm gas than\\nthe H$_2$CO 6 cm line. On the other hand, formaldehyde is more easily\\nphotodissociated and is, therefore, a poorer tracer of the molecular gas\\nlocated immediately behind Photon Dominated Regions.\\n\",\n",

As conceived by Paczynski and Ostriker, this process must be\\nresponsible for the creation of short-period binaries with degenerate\\ncomponents, and, indeed, it has proven capable of accounting for short-period\\nbinaries containing one white dwarf component. However, attempts to reconstruct\\nthe evolutionary histories of close double white dwarfs have proven more\\nproblematic, and point to the need for enhanced systemic mass loss, either\\nduring the close of the first, slow episode of mass transfer that produced the\\nfirst white dwarf, or during the detached phase preceding the final, common\\nenvelope episode. The survival of long-period interacting binaries with massive\\nwhite dwarfs, such as the recurrent novae T CrB and RS Oph, also presents\\ninterpretative difficulties for simple energetic treatments of common envelope\\nevolution. Their existence implies that major terms are missing from usual\\nformulations of the energy budget for common envelope evolution. The most\\nplausible missing energy term is the energy released by recombination in the\\ncommon envelope, and, indeed, a simple reformulation the energy budget\\nexplicitly including recombination resolves this issue.\\n',\n",

       "  \"  Current cone jet algorithms, widely used at hadron colliders, take event\\nparticles as seeds in an iterative search for stable cones. A longstanding\\ninfrared (IR) unsafety issue in such algorithms is often assumed to be solvable\\nby adding extra `midpoint' seeds, but actually is just postponed to one order\\nhigher in the coupling. A proper solution is to switch to an exact seedless\\ncone algorithm, one that provably identifies all stable cones. The only\\nexisting approach takes N 2^N time to find jets among N particles, making it\\nunusable at hadron level. This can be reduced to N^2 ln(N) time, leading to\\ncode (SISCone) whose speed is similar to that of public midpoint\\nimplementations. Monte Carlo tests provide a strong cross-check of an\\nanalytical proof of the IR safety of the new algorithm, and the absence of any\\n'R_{sep}' issue implies a good practical correspondence between parton and\\nhadron levels. Relative to a midpoint cone, the use of an IR safe seedless\\nalgorithm leads to modest changes for inclusive jet spectra, mostly through\\nreduced sensitivity to the underlying event, and significant changes for some\\nmulti-jet observables.\\n\",\n",

The dynamical evolution of a 0.9 Msun + 0.6 Msun CO white\\ndwarf merger is followed by a three-dimensional SPH simulation. We use an\\nelaborate prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially absent,\\nunless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of SPH particles than\\nearlier calculations. Based on this simulation, we suggest that the central\\nregion of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium,\\nbe approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of a\\nslowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by a\\ncentrifugally supported disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant that\\nmimics the results of the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamic\\nstellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The stellar\\nevolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled by\\nneutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, and\\nthat carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effective\\naccretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretion\\nof cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of double\\nCO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Our results imply that\\nat least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered good\\ncandidates for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. In this case, the\\ncharacteristic time delay between the initial dynamical merger and the eventual\\nexplosion would be ~10^5 yr. (Abridged).\\n',\n",

       "  '  Close pre-main-sequence binary stars are expected to clear central holes in\\ntheir protoplanetary disks, but the extent to which material can flow from the\\ncircumbinary disk across the gap onto the individual circumstellar disks has\\nbeen unclear. In binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of the\\nouter disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting in\\naccretion that varies with the binary period. This accretion may manifest\\nitself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. Here we present a\\nsearch for such periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopic\\nbinary UZ Tau E. We present BVRI photometry spanning three years; we find that\\nthe brightness of UZ Tau E is clearly periodic, with a best-fit period of 19.16\\n+/- 0.04 days. This is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19.13\\ndays, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial velocity data. The\\nbrightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overall\\nperiodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more than\\nhalf the binary orbital period. The variability of the H-alpha line is not as\\nclearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic component\\nis not ruled out. The photometric variations are in good agreement with\\npredictions from simulations of binaries with orbital parameters similar to\\nthose of UZ Tau E, suggesting that periodic accretion does occur from\\ncircumbinary disks, replenishing the inner disks and possibly extending the\\ntimescale over which they might form planets.\\n',\n",

It is found that, with the introduction of node deleting, network\\nstructure is significantly transformed. In particular, degree distribution of\\nthe network undergoes a transition from scale-free to exponential forms as the\\nintensity of node deleting increases. At the same time, nontrivial\\ndisassortative degree correlation develops spontaneously as a natural result of\\nnetwork evolution in the model. We also demonstrate that node deleting\\nintroduced in the model does not destroy the connectedness of a growing network\\nso long as the increasing rate of edges is not excessively small. In addition,\\nit is found that node deleting will weaken but not eliminate the small-world\\neffect of a growing network, and generally it will decrease the clustering\\ncoefficient in a network.\\n',\n",

While the overall trends reported in an earlier investigation are\\nconfirmed by our work, we also find that numerical resolution plays an\\nimportant role during the long-term, nonlinear behaviour of the instability,\\nwhich has implications on the dynamics of rotating stars and on the attainable\\namplitudes of the associated gravitational wave signals.\\n',\n",

       "  '  Population structure induced by both spatial embedding and more general\\nnetworks of interaction, such as model social networks, have been shown to have\\na fundamental effect on the dynamics and outcome of evolutionary games. These\\neffects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlying\\ntopology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that is\\ndescribed by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe this\\nmodel is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend on\\nthe details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of\\na system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes\\nthrough two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population\\nstructure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the\\neffective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local\\ndynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a\\ncontinuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations\\nwith hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio\\nbecomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial\\nstructure to the repeated prisoner\\'s dilemma we uncover a novel and\\ncounterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains\\ncooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner\\'s\\ndilemma and also of the \"rock-paper-scissor\" game we find indications of rich\\nstructure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other models\\nwith explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity and\\nthe emergence of global oscillations.\\n',\n",

       "  '  The structure of three laminar premixed rich flames has been investigated: a\\npure methane flame and two methane flames doped by allene and propyne,\\nrespectively. The gases of the three flames contain 20.9% (molar) of methane\\nand 33.4% of oxygen, corresponding to an equivalence ratio of 1.25 for the pure\\nmethane flame. In both doped flames, 2.49% of C3H4 was added, corresponding to\\na ratio C3H4/CH4 of 12% and an equivalence ratio of 1.55. The three flames have\\nbeen stabilized on a burner at a pressure of 6.7 kPa using argon as dilutant,\\nwith a gas velocity at the burner of 36 cm/s at 333 K. The concentration\\nprofiles of stable species were measured by gas chromatography after sampling\\nwith a quartz microprobe. Quantified species included carbon monoxide and\\ndioxide, methane, oxygen, hydrogen, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, propyne,\\nallene, propene, propane, 1,2-butadiene, 1,3-butadiene, 1-butene, isobutene,\\n1-butyne, vinylacetylene, and benzene. The temperature was measured using a\\nPtRh (6%)-PtRh (30%) thermocouple settled inside the enclosure and ranged from\\n700 K close to the burner up to 1850 K. In order to model these new results,\\nsome improvements have been made to a mechanism previously developed in our\\nlaboratory for the reactions of C3-C4 unsaturated hydrocarbons. The main\\nreaction pathways of consumption of allene and propyne and of formation of C6\\naromatic species have been derived from flow rate analyses.\\n',\n",

       "  \"  Structure entails function and thus a structural description of the brain\\nwill help to understand its function and may provide insights into many\\nproperties of brain systems, from their robustness and recovery from damage, to\\ntheir dynamics and even their evolution. Advances in the analysis of complex\\nnetworks provide useful new approaches to understanding structural and\\nfunctional properties of brain networks. Structural properties of networks\\nrecently described allow their characterization as small-world, random\\n(exponential) and scale-free. They complement the set of other properties that\\nhave been explored in the context of brain connectivity, such as topology,\\nhodology, clustering, and hierarchical organization. Here we apply new network\\nanalysis methods to cortical inter-areal connectivity networks for the cat and\\nmacaque brains. We compare these corticocortical fibre networks to benchmark\\nrewired, small-world, scale-free and random networks, using two analysis\\nstrategies, in which we measure the effects of the removal of nodes and\\nconnections on the structural properties of the cortical networks. The brain\\nnetworks' structural decay is in most respects similar to that of scale-free\\nnetworks. The results implicate highly connected hub-nodes and bottleneck\\nconnections as structural basis for some of the conditional robustness of brain\\nsystems.

An alternative explanation for CB54YC1-I is\\nthat the source is an embedded protostar viewed at an extremely high\\ninclination angle, and the near-infrared detections are not of the central\\nprotostar, but of light scattered by the accretion disk into our line of sight.\\nIn addition, we have discovered three new mid-infrared sources, which are\\nspatially coincident with the previously known dense core in CB54. The source\\ntemperatures ($\\\\sim100$K) and association of the mid-infrared sources with the\\ndense core suggests that these mid-infrared objects may be embedded class 0\\nprotostars.\\n',\n",

Our\\nspectroscopic analysis yields a spectral type of G1-1.5V and an age of about\\n100 Myrs. Variations in stellar radial velocity of HD 70573 have been monitored\\nsince December 2003 until January 2007. The velocity accuracy of FEROS within\\nthis period is about 10 m/s.

And\\nbecause the relative positions of singularities are necessary to compute the\\nsuperpotential, for example, this is a framework in which the arbitrariness of\\ngeometrically engineered models can be greatly reduced.\\n  In our earlier paper, this picture was made concrete for the case of\\ndeforming the representations of an SU(5) model into their Standard Model\\ncontent. In this paper we continue that discussion to show how a geometrically\\nengineered 16 of SO(10) can be unfolded into the Standard Model, and how the\\nthree families of the Standard Model uniquely emerge from the unfolding of a\\nsingle, isolated E8 singularity.\\n\",\n",

Due to the difficulties of forming these\\n`hot Jupiters' in situ, they are generally assumed to have migrated to their\\npresent orbits through interactions with their nascent discs. In this paper, we\\npresent a systematic study of giant planet migration in power law discs. We\\nfind that the planetary migration rate is proportional to the disc surface\\ndensity. This is inconsistent with the assumption that the migration rate is\\nsimply the viscous drift speed of the disc. However, this result can be\\nobtained by balancing the angular momentum of the planet with the viscous\\ntorque in the disc. We have verified that this result is not affected by\\nadjusting the resolution of the grid, the smoothing length used, or the time at\\nwhich the planet is released to migrate.\\n\",\n",

       "  '  The Sun was recently predicted to be an extended source of gamma-ray\\nemission, produced by inverse-Compton scattering of cosmic-ray electrons with\\nthe solar radiation. The emission was predicted to contribute to the diffuse\\nextragalactic background even at large angular distances from the Sun. While\\nthis emission is expected to be readily detectable in future by GLAST, the\\nsituation for available EGRET data is more challenging. We present a detailed\\nstudy of the EGRET database, using a time dependent analysis, accounting for\\nthe effect of the emission from 3C 279, the moon, and other sources, which\\ninterfere with the solar signal. The technique has been tested on the moon\\nsignal, with results consistent with previous work. We find clear evidence for\\nemission from the Sun and its vicinity.

These data confirm the presence of a cold dust disk\\naround TWA 7, a member of the TW Hydrae Association. Based on the 850 micron\\nflux, we estimate the mass of the disk to be 18 lunar masses (0.2 Earth masses)\\nassuming a mass opacity of 1.7 cm^2/g with a temperature of 45 K.

This is consistent with TWA 7 being slightly\\nyounger than AU Mic. We find that the mid-IR and submillimeter data require the\\ndisk to be comprised of dust at a range of temperatures.

We base our\\nwork mainly on two XMM-Newton observations of GX 339-4, because they provided\\nhigh-quality data at low energies (below 1 keV) which are critical for reliably\\nmodeling the spectrum of the accretion disk. A key issue examined is the\\ndetermination of the so-called \"color correction factor\", which is often\\nempirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrum\\nfrom a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot be\\npre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretion\\nrate, among a number of important factors. We follow up on an earlier\\nsuggestion to estimate the color correction observationally by modeling the\\ndisk spectrum with saturated Compton scattering.

Gas with Z >=\\n10^-3 Zsolar is able to cool to the temperature of the CMB, which sets a lower\\nlimit to the minimum fragmentation mass. This suggests that the second\\ngeneration stars produced a spectrum of lower mass stars, but were still more\\nmassive on average than stars formed in the local universe.\\n',\n",

The pre-equilibrium Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) is used\\nto probe the fusion path. It is shown that such isovector collective state is\\nexcited in N/Z asymmetric fusion and to a less extent in mass asymmetric\\nsystems. The characteristics of this GDR are governed by the structure of the\\nfused system in its preequilibrium phase, like its deformation, rotation and\\nvibration. In particular, we show that a lowering of the pre-equilibrium GDR\\nenergy is expected as compared to the statistical one. Revisiting experimental\\ndata, we extract an evidence of this lowering for the first time. We also\\nquantify the fusion-evaporation enhancement due to gamma-ray emission from the\\npre-equilibrium GDR. This cooling mechanism along the fusion path may be\\nsuitable to synthesize in the future super heavy elements using radioactive\\nbeams with strong N/Z asymmetries in the entrance channel.\\n',\n",

Therefore the dominant population of long-period IPs,\\nwhich have white dwarf spin periods roughly ten times shorter than their\\norbital periods, will likely end up as short-period IPs like SDSS J2333, with\\nspin periods a large fraction of their orbital periods.\\n\",\n",

The observations resolved the\\nhot molecular core into six submm continuum sources with the finest spatial\\nresolution of 0.36''x0.25'' (~1800AU) achieved so far. Four of them located\\nwithin 7800(AU)^2 comprise a proto-Trapezium system with estimated protostellar\\ndensities of 1.4x0^5 protostars/pc^3. The plethora of ~80 spectral lines allows\\nus to study the molecular outflow(s), the core kinematics, the temperature\\nstructure of the region as well as chemical effects. The derived hot core\\ntemperatures are of the order 300K. We find interesting chemical spatial\\ndifferentiations, e.g., C34S is deficient toward the hot core and is enhanced\\nat the UCHII/hot core interface, which may be explained by temperature\\nsensitive desorption from grains and following gas phase chemistry. The\\nSiO(8-7) emission outlines likely two molecular outflows emanating from this\\nhot core region. Emission from most other molecules peaks centrally on the hot\\ncore and is not dominated by any individual submm peak. Potential reasons for\\nthat are discussed. A few spectral lines that are associated with the main\\nsubmm continuum source, show a velocity gradient perpendicular to the\\nlarge-scale outflow. Since this velocity structure comprises three of the\\ncentral protostellar sources, this is not a Keplerian disk. While the data are\\nconsistent with a gas core that may rotate and/or collapse, we cannot exclude\\nthe outflow(s) and/or nearby expanding UCHII region as possible alternative\\ncauses of this velocity pattern.\\n\",\n",

It has\\ngenerally been assumed in prior studies that the many-to-one throughput\\ncapacity is upper-bounded by the link capacity L. Throughput capacity L is not\\nachievable under 802.11. This paper introduces the notion of \"canonical\\nnetworks\", which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacities\\ncan be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks. We show that the\\nthroughput capacity of canonical networks under 802.11 has an analytical upper\\nbound of 3L/4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink;\\nand simulated throughputs of 0.690L (0.740L) when the source nodes are many\\nhops away. We conjecture that 3L/4 is also the upper bound for general\\nnetworks. When all links have equal length, 2L/3 can be shown to be the upper\\nbound for general networks. Our simulations show that 802.11 networks with\\nrandom topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs far\\nbelow the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near the\\ngateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) to\\nfashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can be\\nimproved significantly by more than 150%. Indeed, in a dense network, it is\\nworthwhile to deactivate some of the relay nodes near the sink judiciously.\\n',\n",

Understanding the mechanisms which\\nlead to multiple globular cluster sub-populations is essential for a complete\\npicture of massive galaxy formation. By assuming that globular cluster\\nformation traces the total star formation and taking into account the radial\\nvariations in the composite stellar populations predicted by the Pipino &\\nMatteucci (2004) multi-zone photo-chemical evolution code, we compute the\\ndistribution of globular cluster properties as a function of galactocentric\\nradius.

Our model predicts the presence of a super-metal-rich population\\nof globular clusters in the most massive elliptical galaxies, which is in very\\ngood agreement with the spectroscopic observations. Furthermore, we investigate\\nthe impact of other non-linear mechanisms that shape the metallicity\\ndistribution of globular cluster systems, in particular the role of\\nmerger-induced globular cluster formation and a non-linear color-metallicity\\ntransformation, and discuss their influence in the context of our model\\n(abridged)\\n',\n",

Archival INTEGRAL data\\nand RXTE observations showed that the outbursts occur with a periodicity of\\n~330 days. Thus, IGR J11215-5952 is the first SFXT displaying periodic\\noutbursts, possibly related to the orbital period. We performed a Target of\\nOpportunity observation with Swift with the main aim of monitoring the source\\nbehaviour around the time of the fifth outburst, expected on 2007 Feb 9. The\\nsource field was observed with Swift twice a day (2ks/day) starting from 4th\\nFebruary, 2007, until the fifth outburst, and then for ~5 ks a day afterwards,\\nduring a monitoring campaign that lasted 23 days for a total on-source exposure\\nof ~73 ks. This is the most complete monitoring campaign of an outburst from a\\nSFXT. The spectrum during the brightest flares is well described by an absorbed\\npower law with a photon index of 1 and N_H~1 10^22 cm^-2. A 1-10 keV peak\\nluminosity of ~10^36 erg s^-1 was derived (assuming 6.2 kpc, the distance of\\nthe optical counterpart). These Swift observations are a unique data-set for an\\noutburst of a SFXT, thanks to the combination of sensitivity and time coverage,\\nand they allowed a study of IGR J11215-5952 from outburst onset to almost\\nquiescence. We find that the accretion phase lasts longer than previously\\nthought on the basis of lower sensitivity instruments observing only the\\nbrightest flares. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a smoothly\\nincreasing flux triggered at the periastron passage in a wide eccentric orbit\\nwith many flares superimposed, possibly due to episodic or inhomogeneous\\naccretion.\\n',\n",

To\\nthis end, the SLIV which evolves in a general Yang-Mills type theory with the\\nnonlinear vector field constraint $Tr(% \\\\boldsymbol{A}_{\\\\mu\\n}\\\\boldsymbol{A}^{\\\\mu})=\\\\pm M^{2}$ ($M$ is a proposed SLIV scale) imposed is\\nconsidered in detail. With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generators\\nnot only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry\\n$SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously broken\\nas well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only one\\ngenuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons\\nrelated to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangement\\nof the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remain\\nstrictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theory\\ninvolved. We show that, although this theory contains a plethora of Lorentz and\\n$CPT$ violating couplings, they do not lead to physical SLIV effects which turn\\nout to be strictly cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered.\\nHowever, the physical Lorentz violation could appear if the internal gauge\\ninvariance were slightly broken at very small distances influenced by gravity.\\nFor the SLIV scale comparable with the Planck one the Lorentz violation could\\nbecome directly observable at low energies.\\n',\n",

In particular, using a fully covariant\\nrelativistic transport approach, we see that the density dependence of the {\\\\it\\ninelastic} cross sections appreciably affects the pion and kaon yields and\\ntheir rapidity distributions. However, the $(\\\\pi^{-}/\\\\pi^{+})$- and\\n$(K^{0}/K^{+})$-ratios depend only moderately on the in-medium behavior of the\\ninelastic cross sections.

As a\\nconsequence we expect rather reduced effects on the yield ratios.

We develop a general\\nscheme for constructing composite-fermion (CF) wave functions from conformal\\nfield theory. Quasiparticles at $\\\\nu=1/m$ are created by inserting anyonic\\nvertex operators, $P_{\\\\frac{1}{m}}(z)$, that replace a subset of the electron\\noperators in the correlator. The one-quasiparticle wave function is identical\\nto the corresponding CF wave function, and the two-quasiparticle wave function\\nhas correct fractional charge and statistics and is numerically almost\\nidentical to the corresponding CF wave function. We further show how to exactly\\nrepresent the CF wavefunctions in the Jain series $\\\\nu = s/(2sp+1)$ as the CFT\\ncorrelators of a new type of fermionic vertex operators, $V_{p,n}(z)$,\\nconstructed from $n$ free compactified bosons; these operators provide the CFT\\nrepresentation of composite fermions carrying $2p$ flux quanta in the $n^{\\\\rm\\nth}$ CF Landau level. We also construct the corresponding quasiparticle- and\\nquasihole operators and argue that they have the expected fractional charge and\\nstatistics. For filling fractions 2/5 and 3/7 we show that the chiral CFTs that\\ndescribe the bulk wave functions are identical to those given by Wen's general\\nclassification of quantum Hall states in terms of $K$-matrices and $l$- and\\n$t$-vectors, and we propose that to be generally true. Our results suggest a\\ngeneral procedure for constructing quasiparticle wave functions for other\\nfractional Hall states, as well as for constructing ground states at filling\\nfractions not contained in the principal Jain series.\\n\",\n",

       "  '  The presence of dust at high redshift requires efficient condensation of\\ngrains in SN ejecta, in accordance with current theoretical models. Yet,\\nobservations of the few well studied SNe and SN remnants imply condensation\\nefficiencies which are about two orders of magnitude smaller. Motivated by this\\ntension, we have (i) revisited the model of Todini & Ferrara (2001) for dust\\nformation in the ejecta of core collapse SNe and (ii) followed, for the first\\ntime, the evolution of newly condensed grains from the time of formation to\\ntheir survival - through the passage of the reverse shock - in the SN remnant.\\nWe find that 0.1 - 0.6 M_sun of dust form in the ejecta of 12 - 40 M_sun\\nstellar progenitors. Depending on the density of the surrounding ISM, between\\n2-20% of the initial dust mass survives the passage of the reverse shock, on\\ntime-scales of about 4-8 x 10^4 yr from the stellar explosion. Sputtering by\\nthe hot gas induces a shift of the dust size distribution towards smaller\\ngrains. The resulting dust extinction curve shows a good agreement with that\\nderived by observations of a reddened QSO at z =6.2. Stochastic heating of\\nsmall grains leads to a wide distribution of dust temperatures. This supports\\nthe idea that large amounts (~ 0.1 M_sun) of cold dust (T ~ 40K) can be present\\nin SN remnants, without being in conflict with the observed IR emission.\\n',\n",

The results are interpreted in MSSM benchmark scenarios\\nin terms of the parameters tan_beta and the Higgs-boson mass scale, M_A.

The largest effects\\narise from a change in the higgsino mass parameter mu, which enters both via\\nhigher-order radiative corrections and via the kinematics of Higgs decays into\\nsupersymmetric particles. While the variation of $\\\\mu$ can shift the\\nprospective discovery reach (and correspondingly the ``LHC wedge'' region) by\\nabout Delta tan_beta = 10, we find that the discovery reach is rather stable\\nwith respect to the impact of other supersymmetric parameters. Within the\\ndiscovery region we analyze the accuracy with which the masses of the heavy\\nneutral Higgs bosons can be determined.

We find that\\nthe outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the dense\\nfilaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorption\\nnear galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We\\nalso find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to\\ngalaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the\\ngalaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal\\nabsorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without\\nfeedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50\\nkpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV\\nand OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean\\ntransmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming\\ngalaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is\\nindependent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS\\nwith lower transmissivity of metal lines. Additionally, strong feedback can\\nproduce strong OVI lines even in cases where HI absorption is weak. We conclude\\nthat OVI is probably the best tracer for galactic winds at high redshift.\\n',\n",

       "  '  We quantify the variability of faint unresolved optical sources using a\\ncatalog based on multiple SDSS imaging observations. The catalog covers SDSS\\nStripe 82, and contains 58 million photometric observations in the SDSS ugriz\\nsystem for 1.4 million unresolved sources. In each photometric bandpass we\\ncompute various low-order lightcurve statistics and use them to select and\\nstudy variable sources. We find that 2% of unresolved optical sources brighter\\nthan g=20.5 appear variable at the 0.05 mag level (rms) simultaneously in the g\\nand r bands. The majority (2/3) of these variable sources are low-redshift (<2)\\nquasars, although they represent only 2% of all sources in the adopted\\nflux-limited sample. We find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the\\n0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method for\\nfinding low-redshift quasars as is the UV excess color selection (at high\\nGalactic latitudes). We analyze the distribution of lightcurve skewness for\\nquasars and find that is centered on zero. We find that about 1/4 of the\\nvariable stars are RR Lyrae stars, and that only 0.5% of stars from the main\\nstellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level. The distribution of\\nlightcurve skewness in the g-r vs. u-g color-color diagram on the main stellar\\nlocus is found to be bimodal (with one mode consistent with Algol-like\\nbehavior). Using over six hundred RR Lyrae stars, we demonstrate rich halo\\nsubstructure out to distances of 100 kpc. We extrapolate these results to\\nexpected performance by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and estimate that\\nit will obtain well-sampled 2% accurate, multi-color lightcurves for ~2 million\\nlow-redshift quasars, and will discover at least 50 million variable stars.\\n',\n",

The relative weakness of the constraints on N(HI)\\nand T_h contrast with the narrow limits predicted for the H^O and electron\\ndensity in the LIC at the Sun, n(H^0) = 0.19 - 0.20 cm^-3, and n(e) = 0.07 +/-\\n0.01 cm^-3.

Unlike most forms of\\nstochastic resonance, the output response to suprathreshold random input\\nsignals of arbitrary magnitude is improved by the presence of even small\\namounts of noise. In this paper the information transmission performance of SSR\\nin the limit of a large array size is considered.

       "  '  The rotor-router model is a deterministic analogue of random walk. It can be\\nused to define a deterministic growth model analogous to internal DLA. We prove\\nthat the asymptotic shape of this model is a Euclidean ball, in a sense which\\nis stronger than our earlier work. For the shape consisting of $n=\\\\omega_d r^d$\\nsites, where $\\\\omega_d$ is the volume of the unit ball in $\\\\R^d$, we show that\\nthe inradius of the set of occupied sites is at least $r-O(\\\\log r)$, while the\\noutradius is at most $r+O(r^\\\\alpha)$ for any $\\\\alpha > 1-1/d$. For a related\\nmodel, the divisible sandpile, we show that the domain of occupied sites is a\\nEuclidean ball with error in the radius a constant independent of the total\\nmass. For the classical abelian sandpile model in two dimensions, with $n=\\\\pi\\nr^2$ particles, we show that the inradius is at least $r/\\\\sqrt{3}$, and the\\noutradius is at most $(r+o(r))/\\\\sqrt{2}$. This improves on bounds of Le Borgne\\nand Rossin. Similar bounds apply in higher dimensions.\\n',\n",

The low radio flux\\nemitted by this object, however, is inconsistent with a hard state\\ninterpretation. The accretion rate of NGC 3783 (~7% of the Eddington rate) is\\nsimilar to that of other AGN with `soft' state PSDs and higher than that at\\nwhich the GBH Cyg X-1, with which AGN are often compared, changes between\\n`hard' and `soft' states (~2% of the Eddington rate).

Entanglement is at the\\nheart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for\\napplications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably,\\nentanglement can be \"swapped\": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs\\nA1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a \"Bell-State\\nMeasurement\", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled\\nstate, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common\\npast[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric\\ndown-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6],\\nbut here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources,\\nas originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp\\nsynchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the\\ncoherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased,\\nexceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be\\nreplaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing\\nfor the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment\\nexploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the\\nefficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear\\ncrystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters. This approach is\\nindependent of the form of entanglement; we employed time-bin entangled\\nphotons[9] at telecom wavelengths. Our setup is robust against thermal or\\nmechanical fluctuations in optical fibres thanks to cm-long coherence lengths.\\n',\n",

High critical density lines trace regions with similar\\nphysical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlation\\nbetween line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density lines\\nprobe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a star\\nformation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. We show that a\\nsimple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenous\\ncan quantitatively reproduce the observed correlations between galactic\\nluminosities in far infrared and in the CO(1->0) and HCN(1->0) lines, and\\nnaturally explains why these correlations have different slopes. We predict\\nthat IR-line luminosity correlations should change slope for galaxies in which\\nthe median density is close to the line critical density. This prediction may\\nbe tested by observations of lines such as HCO^+(1->0) with intermediate\\ncritical densities, or by HCN(1->0) observations of intensely star-forming high\\nredshift galaxies with very high densities. Recent observations by Gao et al.\\nhint at just such a change in slope. We argue that deviations from linearity in\\nthe HCN(1->0)-IR correlation at high luminosity are consistent with the\\nassumption of a constant star formation efficiency.\\n\",\n",

We solve numerically\\nthe coupled equations for the three mode amplitudes in conjunction with the\\nspin and temperature evolution equations.

Once these states are reached,\\nthe mode amplitudes can be found algebraically and the system of equations is\\nreduced from eight to two equations: spin and temperature evolution.\\nEventually, the system may reach thermal equilibrium and either (1) undergo a\\ncyclic evolution with a frequency change of at most 10%, (2) evolve toward a\\nfull equilibrium state in which the accretion torque balances the gravitational\\nradiation emission, or (3) enter a thermogravitational runaway on a very long\\ntimescale of about $10^6$ years.

We have detected the red giant branch bump\\nfor the first time, although it is at least 0.2 mag fainter than expected\\nrelative to the turnoff. The number of red giants (relative to main sequence\\nturnoff stars) is in excellent agreement with stellar models from the\\nYonsei-Yale and Teramo groups, and slightly high compared to Victoria-Regina\\nmodels. This adds to evidence that an abnormally large ratio of red giant to\\nmain-sequence stars is not correlated with cluster metallicity. We discuss\\ntheoretical predictions from different research groups and find that the\\ninclusion or exclusion of helium diffusion and strong limit Coulomb\\ninteractions may be partly responsible.\\n  We also examine indicators of dynamical history: the mass function exponent\\nand the blue straggler frequency. NGC 5466 has a very shallow mass function,\\nconsistent with large mass loss and recently-discovered tidal tails. The blue\\nstraggler sample is significantly more centrally concentrated than the HB or\\nRGB stars. We see no evidence of an upturn in the blue straggler frequency at\\nlarge distances from the center. Dynamical friction timescales indicate that\\nthe stragglers should be more concentrated if the cluster's present density\\nstructure has existed for most of its history. NGC 5466 also has an unusually\\nlow central density compared to clusters of similar luminosity. In spite of\\nthis, the specific frequency of blue stragglers that puts it right on the\\nfrequency -- cluster M_V relation observed for other clusters.\\n\",\n",

       "  '  The discovery of a flux excess in the far-ultraviolet (UV) spectrum of\\nelliptical galaxies was a major surprise in 1969. While it is now clear that\\nthis UV excess is caused by an old population of hot helium-burning stars\\nwithout large hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than young stars, their origin\\nhas remained a mystery. Here we show that these stars most likely lost their\\nenvelopes because of binary interactions, similar to the hot subdwarf\\npopulation in our own Galaxy. We have developed an evolutionary population\\nsynthesis model for the far-UV excess of elliptical galaxies based on the\\nbinary model developed by Han et al (2002, 2003) for the formation of hot\\nsubdwarfs in our Galaxy. Despite its simplicity, it successfully reproduces\\nmost of the properties of elliptical galaxies with a UV excess: the range of\\nobserved UV excesses, both in $(1550-V)$ and $(2000-V)$, and their evolution\\nwith redshift. We also present colour-colour diagrams for use as diagnostic\\ntools in the study of elliptical galaxies. The model has major implications for\\nunderstanding the evolution of the UV excess and of elliptical galaxies in\\ngeneral. In particular, it implies that the UV excess is not a sign of age, as\\nhad been postulated previously, and predicts that it should not be strongly\\ndependent on the metallicity of the population, but exists universally from\\ndwarf ellipticals to giant ellipticals.\\n',\n",

One\\nof the most convincing observational arguments in favour of propagation-induced\\nvariability is the so called annual modulation of the characteristic\\nvariability time-scale, which is due to the orbital motion of the Earth. Data\\nfor the recently discovered and highly variable IDV source J1128+5925 are\\npresented. We study the frequency and time dependence of the IDV in this\\ncompact quasar. We measure the characteristic variability time-scale of the IDV\\nthroughout the year, and analyze whether the observed changes in the\\nvariability time-scale are consistent with annual modulation. We monitored the\\nflux density variability of J1128+5925 with dense time sampling between 2.7 and\\n10.45GHz with the 100m Effelsberg radio telescope of the MPIfR and with the 25m\\nUrumqi radio telescope. From ten observing sessions, we determine the\\nvariability characteristics and time-scales. The observed pronounced changes of\\nthe variability time-scale of J1128+5925 are modelled with an anisotropic\\nannual modulation model. The observed frequency dependence of the variation is\\nin good agreement with the prediction from interstellar scintillation. Adopting\\na simple model for the annual modulation model and using also the frequency\\ndependence of the IDV, we derive a lower limit to the distance of the\\nscattering screen and an upper limit to the scintillating source size. The\\nlatter is found to be consistent with the measured core size from VLBI.\\n',\n",

The archi-tecture is complex and includes several layers of\\noverlap-ping error detection and recovery mechanisms. Three ab-straction levels\\nhave been developed to model the cache architecture, cache operations, and\\nerror detection and recovery mechanism. The impact of faults and errors\\noc-curring in the cache and in the disks is analyzed at each level of the\\nhierarchy. A simulation submodel is associated with each abstraction level. The\\nmodels have been devel-oped using DEPEND, a simulation-based environment for\\nsystem-level dependability analysis, which provides facili-ties to inject\\nfaults into a functional behavior model, to simulate error detection and\\nrecovery mechanisms, and to evaluate quantitative measures. Several fault\\nmodels are defined for each submodel to simulate cache component failures, disk\\nfailures, transmission errors, and data errors in the cache memory and in the\\ndisks. Some of the parame-ters characterizing fault injection in a given\\nsubmodel cor-respond to probabilities evaluated from the simulation of the\\nlower-level submodel. Based on the proposed method-ology, we evaluate and\\nanalyze 1) the system behavior un-der a real workload and high error rate\\n(focusing on error bursts), 2) the coverage of the error detection mechanisms\\nimplemented in the system and the error latency distribu-tions, and 3) the\\naccumulation of errors in the cache and in the disks.\\n',\n",

For coupling strength\\nimmediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is the\\non-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in this\\nprocess are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises\\nmost of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is\\ncharacterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small\\nclusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronization\\nbifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number of\\nsmall clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration and\\nseparation of the small clusters.

We\\ninvestigate this phenomenon by a field-theoretical renormalization group\\nanalysis in the two-loop order. We study critical slowing down and obtain\\nquantitative estimates for the effective and asymptotic critical exponents of\\nthe order parameter and scalar density. The results predict complex scenarios\\nfor the effective critical exponent approaching an asymptotic regime.\\n',\n",

Clock frequency shifts due to magnetic and optical fields are\\ndiscussed with an emphasis on those relating to nuclear structure. An\\nexperimental determination of the differential g-factor in $^{87}$Sr is\\nperformed and is in good agreement with theory. The magnitude of the tensor\\nlight shift on the clock states is also explored experimentally. State specific\\nmeasurements with controlled nuclear spin polarization are discussed as a\\nmethod to reduce the nuclear spin-related systematic effects to below\\n10$^{-17}$ in lattice clocks.\\n',\n",

The\\ncarrier of the acceleration in the present de Sitter epoch is a quintessence\\nfield slowly rolling down its exponential potential. Intrinsic to this model is\\na second modulus which is automatically stabilized and acts as a source of cold\\ndark matter with a mass proportional to an exponential function of the\\nquintessence field (hence realizing VAMP models within a String context).\\nHowever, any attempt to saturate the present cold dark matter component in this\\nmanner leads to unacceptable deviations from cosmological data -- a numerical\\nstudy reveals that this source can account for up to about 7% of the total cold\\ndark matter budget. We also show that (1) the model will support a de Sitter\\nenergy in agreement with observation at the expense of a miniscule breaking of\\nsupersymmetry in the compact space; (2) variations in the fine structure\\nconstant are controlled by the stabilized modulus and are negligible; (3)\\n``fifth''forces are carried by the stabilized modulus and are short range; (4)\\nthe long time behavior of the model in four dimensions is that of a\\nRobertson-Walker universe with a constant expansion rate (w = -1/3).

       "  '  Using a semi-analytical model for galaxy formation, combined with a large\\nN-body simulation, we investigate the origin of the dichotomy among early-type\\ngalaxies. We find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitor\\nmass ratio $n < 2$ and with a combined cold gas mass fraction $F_{\\\\rm cold} <\\n0.1$. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as\\na function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and\\nsatellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties of\\nthe last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halo\\nmass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al\\n(2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter that\\ngoverns its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-type\\ngalaxies has a natural explanation within hierarchical structure formation, and\\ndoes not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact that\\nmore massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later,\\nand (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these three\\ntrends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massive\\nearly-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. Finally,\\nour model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxies\\nform in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than\\n95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with $M_* < 2 \\\\times 10^{10} h^{-1}\\n\\\\Msun$ are satellite galaxies, and (iii) about 70 percent of all low mass\\nearly-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last major\\nmerger.

The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in\\ndetermining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link.\\nThese probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate.\\nThe paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the\\nprobabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to\\nmaximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link\\ncommunication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall\\ncommunication budget constraint.

The BAT monitored it recurrently for a total of 2.7 Ms, and the\\nXRT and UVOT pointed it on seven occasions for a total of 67 ks, making it one\\nof the AGNs best monitored by Swift. The automatic optical and infrared\\ntelescope REM has monitored simultaneously the source at all times. In\\nJanuary-February 2005 PKS0537-441 has been detected at its brightest in optical\\nand X-rays: more than a factor of 2 brighter in X-rays and about a factor 60\\nbrighter in the optical than observed in December 2004. The July 2005\\nobservation recorded a fainter X-ray state. The simultaneous optical state,\\nmonitored by both Swift UVOT and REM, is high, and in the VRI bands it is\\ncomparable to what was recorded in early January 2005, before the outburst. In\\nNovember 2005, the source subsided both in X-rays and optical to a quiescent\\nstate, having decreased by factors of ~4 and ~60 with respect to the\\nJanuary-February 2005 outburst, respectively. Our monitoring shows an overall\\nwell correlated optical and X-ray decay. On the shorter time scales (days or\\nhours), there is no obvious correlation between X-ray and optical variations,\\nbut the former tend to be more pronounced, opposite to what is observed on\\nmonthly time scales. The widely different amplitude of the long term\\nvariability in optical and X-rays is very unusual and makes this observation a\\nunique case study for blazar activity. The spectral energy distributions are\\ninterpreted in terms of the synchrotron and inverse Compton mechanisms within a\\njet where the plasma radiates via internal shocks and the dissipation depends\\non the distance of the emitting region from the central engine (abridged).\\n',\n",

       "  '  There are two promising scenarios that explain the ankle, which is a dip in\\nthe spectrum of cosmic rays at $\\\\sim 10^{19}$ eV. A scenario interprets the\\nankle as the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays ({\\\\it\\nankle-transition scenario}), while the other is that the dip caused by pair\\nproduction on the cosmic microwave background radiation ({\\\\it proton-dip\\nscenario}). In this paper, we consider whether cosmogenic neutrinos can be a\\nclue to judge which scenario is favored. We calculated the fluxes of cosmogenic\\nneutrinos following these scenarios with plausible physical parameter sets, and\\nfound several important features as follows. First of all, the neutrino flux at\\n$\\\\sim 10^{20}$ eV becomes much higher in the ankle-transition scenario as long\\nas the maximum energy of the cosmic rays at sources is sufficiently high. On\\nthe other hand, the neutrino spectrum has a characteristic peak at $\\\\sim\\n10^{16}$ eV in the proton-dip scenario on the condition that extragalactic\\nprotons significantly contribute to the observed cosmic rays down to $10^{17}$\\neV. Thus, we conclude cosmogenic neutrinos should give us a clue to judge which\\nscenario is favored, unless these features are masked by the neutrino\\nbackground coming from possible, powerful neutrino sources such as AGNs and\\nGRBs. We also found an interesting feature that the neutrino flux at $\\\\sim\\n10^{18}$ eV depends only on the cosmological evolution of the cosmic ray\\nsources. That means cosmogenic neutrinos with the energy bring us information\\non the cosmological evolution of the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.\\nFinally, we compare the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos with the expected\\nsensitivity curves of several neutrino detectors, and conclude the detection of\\ncosmogenic neutrinos in the near future is promising.\\n',\n",

       "  \"  S255N is a luminous far-infrared source that contains many indications of\\nactive star formation but lacks a prominent near-infrared stellar cluster. We\\npresent mid-infrared through radio observations aimed at exploring the\\nevolutionary state of this region. Our observations include 1.3mm continuum and\\nspectral line data from the Submillimeter Array, VLA 3.6cm continuum and 1.3cm\\nwater maser data, and multicolor IRAC images from the Spitzer Space Telescope.\\nThe cometary morphology of the previously-known UCHII region G192.584-0.041 is\\nclearly revealed in our sensitive, multi-configuration 3.6cm images. The 1.3mm\\ncontinuum emission has been resolved into three compact cores, all of which are\\ndominated by dust emission and have radii < 7000AU. The mass estimates for\\nthese cores range from 6 to 35 Msun. The centroid of the brightest dust core\\n(SMA1) is offset by 1.1'' (2800 AU) from the peak of the cometary UCHII region\\nand exhibits the strongest HC3N, CN, and DCN line emission in the region. SMA1\\nalso exhibits compact CH3OH, SiO, and H2CO emission and likely contains a young\\nhot core. We find spatial and kinematic evidence that SMA1 may contain further\\nmultiplicity, with one of the components coincident with a newly-detected H2O\\nmaser. There are no mid-infrared point source counterparts to any of the dust\\ncores, further suggesting an early evolutionary phase for these objects. The\\ndominant mid-infrared emission is a diffuse, broadband component that traces\\nthe surface of the cometary UCHII region but is obscured by foreground material\\non its southern edge. An additional 4.5 micron linear feature emanating to the\\nnortheast of SMA1 is aligned with a cluster of methanol masers and likely\\ntraces a outflow from a protostar within SMA1. Our observations provide direct\\nevidence that S255N is forming a cluster of intermediate to high-mass stars.\\n\",\n",
